# ⏱️ TIME & WORK (201–210)

---

## 201.

**A can do a work in 10 days. B can do it in 15 days. Together they can finish in:**
A) 5 days
B) 6 days
C) 7 days
D) 8 days

✅ **Answer: B) 6 days**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

* A’s 1-day work = 1/10
* B’s 1-day work = 1/15

Together 1-day work:
[
\frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{15}
]

LCM of 10 and 15 = 30

[
\frac{3}{30} + \frac{2}{30} = \frac{5}{30} = \frac{1}{6}
]

So, total time = **6 days**

---

## 202.

**A does a work in 20 days, B in 30 days. A works alone for 5 days, then B joins. Total time = ?**
A) 10
B) 12
C) 14
D) 15

✅ **Answer: C) 14 days**

---

## 203.

**If A alone can do work in 12 days, work done in 4 days = ?**
A) 1/2
B) 1/3
C) 1/4
D) 1/6

<img width="514" height="224" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfdbf729-31a7-4f09-8111-cd59946a9f7c" />


---

## 204.

**A and B together can do work in 8 days. A alone in 12 days. B alone in:**
A) 18
B) 20
C) 24
D) 30

<img width="467" height="351" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccbe9281-82f8-4185-8bcd-6fd74bd3dc5f" />


---

## 205.

**A can do work in 10 days, B is 50% more efficient. B alone can do in:**
A) 5
B) 6
C) 7
D) 8

✅ **Answer: B) 6 days**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

* A’s efficiency = 1 unit
* B is 50% more efficient ⇒ B = 1.5 units

Time ∝ 1/Efficiency

If A takes 10 days:
[
B = \frac{10}{1.5} = 6.67 \approx 6 \text{ days}
]

---

## 206.

**A, B, C can do work in 6, 8, 12 days respectively. Together time = ?**
A) 2 days
B) 3 days
C) 4 days
D) 5 days

✅ **Answer: B) 3 days**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

[
\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{12}
]

LCM = 24

[
\frac{4+3+2}{24} = \frac{9}{24} = \frac{3}{8}
]

Time:
[
\frac{1}{3/8} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 3
]

---

## 207.

**A does twice the work of B in same time. Ratio of time = ?**
A) 1:2
B) 2:1
C) 3:1
D) 1:3

✅ **Answer: B) 2:1**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

Work ∝ Efficiency
Time ∝ 1/Efficiency

If A does double work ⇒ A is twice as efficient
So time ratio = **inverse**

[
A : B = 1/2 : 1 = 2 : 1
]

---

## 208.

**A and B together take 15 days. A alone takes 20 days. B alone takes:**
A) 30
B) 40
C) 60
D) 45

✅ **Answer: C) 60 days**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

* Together = 1/15
* A alone = 1/20

B’s work:
[
\frac{1}{15} - \frac{1}{20}
]

LCM = 60

[
\frac{4-3}{60} = \frac{1}{60}
]

So B alone takes **60 days**

---

## 209.

**If 5 men can do work in 10 days, 10 men will do in:**
A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5

<img width="514" height="146" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0849e740-d10d-41ad-94f9-93be18d2ede0" />


---

## 210.

**A completes work in 12 days. After 6 days, B joins and total work finishes in 9 days. B alone takes:**
A) 12
B) 18
C) 24
D) 36

✅ **Answer: B) 18 days**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

A’s work in 6 days:
[
6 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{2}
]

Remaining work = 1/2
Remaining time = 3 days

Combined rate:
[
\frac{1/2}{3} = \frac{1}{6}
]

B’s rate:
[
\frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{12}
]

So B alone = **18 days**

---

# 🚰 PIPES & CISTERNS (211–215)

---

## 211.

**Pipe A fills tank in 10 hrs, B in 20 hrs. Together time = ?**
A) 5
B) 6.67
C) 8
D) 10

✅ **Answer: B) 6.67 hrs**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

\Rightarrow 24 \text{ hrs}
]

(Answer correction: **Option should be 24**, question key was wrong)

---

## 213.

**Two pipes fill tank in 6 hrs & 12 hrs. Time together = ?**
A) 3
B) 4
C) 5
D) 6

✅ **Answer: B) 4 hrs**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

[
\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\Rightarrow 4 \text{ hrs}
]

---

## 214.

**Pipe A fills in 8 hrs, B empties in 16 hrs. Tank filled in:**
A) 8
B) 12
C) 16
D) 24

✅ **Answer: B) 16 hrs**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

[
\frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{1}{16}
\Rightarrow 16 \text{ hrs}
]

---

## 215.

**Three pipes fill in 10, 15, 30 hrs. Together time = ?**
A) 5
B) 6
C) 7
D) 8

✅ **Answer: B) 6 hrs**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

[
\frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{15} + \frac{1}{30}
= \frac{3+2+1}{30} = \frac{6}{30} = \frac{1}{5}
\Rightarrow 5 \text{ hrs}
]

(Key correction: correct time = **5 hrs**, options mismatched)

A) 8
B) 10
C) 12
D) 14

✅ **Answer: C) 12 km/h**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

A) 4
B) 5
C) 6
D) 7

✅ **Answer: B) 5 hours**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

**If A is twice as fast as B, time ratio = ?**
A) 1:2
B) 2:1
C) 3:1
D) 1:3

✅ **Answer: A) 1:2**

[
A:B = 1:2
]

---

## 232.

**5 men do work in 12 days. 10 men will do in:**
A) 5
B) 6
C) 7
D) 8

✅ **Answer: B) 6 days**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

**Speed increases by 25%, time decreases by:**
A) 20%
B) 25%
C) 30%
D) 15%

✅ **Answer: A) 20%**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

When speed increases by **x%**, time decreases by:

[
\frac{x}{100+x} \times 100
]

[
= \frac{25}{125} \times 100 = 20%
]

---

## 234.

A) 40
B) 50
C) 60
D) 70

✅ **Answer: C) 60 hours**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

* Filling rate = 1/20
* Emptying rate = 1/30

Net rate:
[
\frac{1}{20} - \frac{1}{30}
]

LCM = 60

[
\frac{3 - 2}{60} = \frac{1}{60}
]

So, total time = **60 hours**

---

## 235.

A) 80
B) 90
C) 100
D) 120

✅ **Answer: C) 100 m**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

Convert speed:
[

]

Distance covered in 10 sec:
[
10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ m}
]

---

## 236.

**Work is proportional to:**
A) Speed
B) Time
C) Speed × Time

A) 5
B) 6
C) 7
D) 8

✅ **Answer: B) 6 hours**

### 📖 Full Explanation:

Rates:
[
A = \frac{1}{10}, \quad B = \frac{1}{15}
]

[
\frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{15} = \frac{3+2}{30} = \frac{5}{30} = \frac{1}{6}
]

Time = **6 hours**

---

## 239.

**Relative speed (same direction) = ?**
A) Sum
B) Difference
C) Product
D) Average
